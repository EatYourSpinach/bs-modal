Bootstrap modal implemented in polymer, no jquery here.
If you're on a mac run a 'sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer <pick a port>' and point your browser at the test.html file to see it working.

- Attributes:
    - open: bind this to a variable and toggle the variable to open/close
- Events:
    - on-backgroundtap: bind this to a function to do something when the background is clicked. Normally closing the dialog.
